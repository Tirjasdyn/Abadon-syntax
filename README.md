# Abadon-syntax
Atom Syntax Theme based on the [Anderson Dark Syntax Theme](https://atom.io/themes/anderson-dark-syntax). I used this to learn how the syntax theme system worked and find the items I wanted to be sure to call out. 

Abadon is dark theme with highlighting in dark pastels. Punctuation is called out in different colors as well as HTML entities. I use this with the One Dark UI theme. This theme is update to date with Atom 1.211 release.
